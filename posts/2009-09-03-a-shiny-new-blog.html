<p>Expiration of my account at <a href="http://hub.org">hub.org</a>, and my
discovery of <a href="http://mosso.com">mosso</a> &amp;
<a href="http://slicehost.com">slicehost</a> has prompted me to move all my
personal shit around… Along with that move I figured I might as well
disband my efforts at a ground up implementation of every piece of
technology required to run a site, and just throw apache, php, and a
little wordpress at the problem (sorry erlang &amp; yaws, I still love
you. don’t hate me ruby &amp; lighttpd, you guys are really cute!). This
is a common theme in my life, get stuck in the interesting problems
that pop up while trying to solve a problem…</p>

<p>anyhow, welcome! we will shortly return to your previously scheduled
programming (woteva that woz)…</p>
