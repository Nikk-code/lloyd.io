title: matz, the ruby trunk, and GC changes
published: true

<p>w00t. An email from matz, and a little spelunking in the ruby subversion
repository shows that there’s some tinkering going on in ruby garbage
collection land. Here are the interesting change logs:</p>

* gc.c (add_heap): sort heaps array in ascending order to use
  binary search.

* gc.c (is_pointer_to_heap): use binary search to identify object
  in heaps.  works better when number of heap segments grow big.</pre></div>
</div>


<p>and</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>r16194 | matz | 2008-04-25 03:03:32 -0600 (Fri, 25 Apr 2008) | 7 lines

* gc.c (free_unused_heaps): preserve last used heap segment to
  reduce malloc() call.

* gc.c (HEAP_SIZE): use smaller heap segment (2K) for more chance
  to be freed.  based on patch from authorNari .

* gc.c (rb_newobj_from_heap): eventually allocate heap segments.</pre></div>
</div>


<p>So now in ruby 1.9 trunk we’re keeping heaps in sorted order
by memory address, and using binary search to answer the
is_pointer_to_heap() question quickly. This optimizes things
to the point where we can really crank down heap size. Smaller heaps means
more OS reclaimation, means reduced resource usage, and should even mean
a ruby with reduced COW badness. All this at a minimal performance impact
for normal execution (maybe none, matz knows).</p>

<p>So applause to open source, and matz specifically for sifting through all
the ideas/hacks/and patches to realize this thing. It will be interesting
to include 1.9 in the</p>
