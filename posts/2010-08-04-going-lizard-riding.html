<h1>Looking Back &mdash; Goodbye Yahoo!</h1>

<p>Six years ago, when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WUF_Networks">little
startup</a> I worked for was
swallowed up by a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/livenature/412180053/">big purple cow</a>, I was convinced that I would be
gone just as soon as possible &mdash; I had a deep skepticism of large companies and
more generally any large organization of people.  There is no way I would have been able
to predict that half a decade later I would still be at Yahoo!, and
more interestingly, that I would be so proud of the colleagues and
friends I&rsquo;d gained and the accomplishments we shared.</p>

<p>Specifically, working on <a href="http://browserplus.yahoo.com/">BrowserPlus</a> has been an amazing experience.
With a small team of wonderfully adept people supported by a diverse network
of folks all over the company, we realized an idea,
scaled it to tens of millions of users speaking over 30 different
languages, and figured out how to surmount any obstacle that came our
way: from managing internal company dynamics &mdash; to dealing with (not
so) subtle changes in the behavior of the browsers upon which we
built &mdash; to tough design challenges which raised legal, privacy,
security, and engineering issues.  This project continues to be
technically interesting because it lies at the intersection of many different
disciplines, and I believe it is <em>important</em> in that it demonstrates a real opportunity to
accelerate the development of the web platform by making it much more
inclusive and organic.</p>

<p>While these couple weeks at Yahoo! will be my last, I leave with
nothing but love for the people I&rsquo;ve met at Yahoo!, and have enormous
hope for the future of BrowserPlus.</p>

<h1>Looking Inward&hellip;</h1>

<p>Recently I decided it was time to find a new mountain.  A decision
which led to several months wondering what would be the most
meaningful and rewarding thing I could do with myself professionally.  Having spent
all that time sitting and thinking, I didn&rsquo;t emerge with a clear answer, however I did
come to a couple conclusions:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m most happy when I&rsquo;m able to create stuff with beauty and
utility (and I&rsquo;ll often trade some units of the former to achieve more
of the latter).</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s nothing quite as fun as doing #1 with other people.</li>
<li>&nbsp;#2 becomes a lot more likely when you give the stuff in #1 away.</li>
<li>An exception to #2 might be when other people themselves are
empowered to do #1 because of stuff <em>you&rsquo;ve</em> made.</li>
</ol>


<p>Decrypted and rearranged, what that really means is that I&rsquo;m
interested in spending more time creating.  Creating open source
platforms, tools, and toys which allow me to work with, learn from,
and empower folks.  That&rsquo;s all.  Why create?  Well _why once said it
well:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>When you donâ€™t create things, you become defined by your tastes
rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow and exclude people. so
create.</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Why the Lucky Stiff</p>

<h1>Looking Forward &mdash; &lsquo;lo liz</h1>

<p>When an opportunity popped up to join <a href="http://mozillalabs.com/">Mozilla
Labs</a> I was instantly intrigued.  The mission
of mozilla resonates well with my recipe for happiness, they believe
that &ldquo;openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued
health of the Internet&rdquo;.  Openness?  That&rsquo;s #2 and #3 above.
Innovation?  #1. And opportunity?  Clearly, #4.  Heeey, will ya look
at that?  We&rsquo;re a perfect match!  Further, the focus and structure of the
labs group seems like it matches my natural way of being &mdash; keep several
experimental projects of different scope going simultaneously, pursue them
for some number of months, collaborate constantly, learn, and move on.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s so much more important to me than how well I feel the organization
I&rsquo;m joining fits me, are the people.  I&rsquo;ve
been talking to and learning from members of the labs team and mozilla
from a distance for a while now, and am jazzed at the opportunity to
finally get to play with them directly.</p>

<p>So with that, I&rsquo;m off to buy a bigger saddle.</p>
