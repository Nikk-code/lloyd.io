<p>A set of questions that can be used as a jump off point for discussions and learning about computers the internet, and programming.</p>

<h2>Theory Questions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>What is assembly language?</li>
<li>What’s the difference between a compiled and interpreted programming language?</li>
<li>At a very high level, how do computers communicate over a network?</li>
<li>what is the “emacs vs vi” discussion? What are emacs and vi?</li>
<li>What is SSH? What is telnet? Why is ssh better than telnet?</li>
</ol>


<h2>Programming Questions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>find and download emacs for windows.</li>
<li>How do you delete a line?</li>
<li>How do you go to the next line</li>
<li>How do you paste the line you deleted above?</li>
<li>How would you go to line 222 of a file?</li>
<li>How do you save a file?
6 How do you create a new file?</li>
<li>What is the ruby programming language? (use wikipedia, dude)</li>
<li>What is ruby rails? Why are people so excited about ruby rails?</li>
<li>download and install the ruby interpreter <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">http://ruby-lang.org</a></li>
<li>write a “hello world” program (first you have to figure out what that is) use emacs to do this</li>
</ol>


<h2>Database Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>What is SQL? What is it used for?</li>
<li>How is information organized in a relational database?</li>
<li>(challenge) Read and summarize the first chapter of “Data Base Design”</li>
</ol>


<h2>Unix questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>You are going to need an ssh client for windows. I suggest “putty”, find it and download it</li>
<li>create a an account on freeshell.org</li>
<li>you’ll find emacs on freeshell, probably</li>
<li>read and summarize the key ideas of the first chapter of “Learning the bash shell”. In your own words, what is bash and what does it do for you?</li>
<li>figure out how to log into freeshell using ssh (putty) and how to set your shell to bash (the chsh command should help) type “man chsh” to get a MANual page of the ‘chsh’ command</li>
<li>write a “hello world” program in bash shell (you’ll need emacs). using the web for help is perfectly fine here.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Web Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>What is HTML and how does it work?</li>
<li>How is HTML related to XML?</li>
<li>What is “javascript” and why is it considered a “web technology”?</li>
<li>What is CSS and what is it used for?</li>
<li>use your freeshell account to make yourself a website.</li>
</ol>
