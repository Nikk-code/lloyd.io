<p>As I spend more and more of my free time digging around in reptilian
mailing lists and such, I find that I&rsquo;ve begun feeling itchy.  Here
are four little itches that might be interesting for someone to
scratch, micro-projects if you will:</p>

<h2>Pass Files through NPAPI</h2>

<p>Plugins like Adobe flash and Yahoo! BrowserPlus often implement their
own native file selection dialogs, and (in the case of the latter),
native drag and drop support.  Especially as e10s takes off, this is
fragile code at best, justified because improved file selection and
dnd support are both of high value to users.</p>

<p>What should happen is UAs should (and are) implementing improved
file (multi) selection and file system sourced Drag and Drop,
and then should be able to securely transmit these files through NPAPI,
in such a way that the plugin author can <em>know</em> that the file was
selected through user interaction, giving her implicit permission to
read the file selected.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://trickyco.de/npapi-the-html5-file-object-and-the-glory-of">wrote
up</a>
my initial thoughts on this a while ago, what needs to be done is a
proper proposal needs to be figured out, fleshed out, and perhaps a
patch provided.  Doing this would improve plugin security and
stability as well as UI consistency for all plugins that operate on
files.</p>

<h2>Explore Simplified web Scriptable API exposure in JetPack</h2>

<p>There is a class of extensions/jetpacks that will want to expose
scriptable APIs to webpages.  This class of jetpacks is especially
interesting to me, as it becomes a way that many new proposed &ldquo;HTML5&rdquo;
APIs can be sketched up at (for instance, see the checksum project idea
below).  Currently it looks like you have to bend over backwords to make
this work: Two <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs-jetpack/browse_thread/thread/8bf77485826beffb/c15813c0bfadc3ad?lnk=gst&amp;q=hilaiel#c15813c0bfadc3ad">functional solutions were provided</a> by Atul and Ben, neither of which
are particularly satisfying.</p>

<p>There are two parts to this problem, one is crafting a specific API in
the context of the evaluating page, and the forthcoming page mod API
should provide this, the next is the question of plumbing, an efficient
means of message passing between trusted and untrusted code that is
e10s proof.</p>

<p>The question: What types of abstractions beyond what&rsquo;s planned today
should be provided to make the process of exposing web callable
functions simpler and more secure?</p>

<h2>Browser to expose checksums for currently installed plugins</h2>

<p>This is from a <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/plugin-futures/2010-July/000149.html">conversation on
<a href="mailto:plugin-futures@mozilla.org">plugin-futures@mozilla.org</a></a>
which is motivated by the desire to improve the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/">plugin-check</a>
tool.  Ryan did a <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/plugin-futures/2010-July/000162.html">fair summary of the tradeoffs</a>
of a &ldquo;guid approach&rdquo; (requiring vendors to encode ownership and version metadata in their plugins), vs. a &ldquo;md5 approach&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This micro project would be to sketch up a jetpack which adds an web
accessible API to get plugin md5, then sketch up the system which
collects user contributed plugin identification information.  It could
take a couple days or a couple weeks.</p>

<p>Key question: How does a system which identifies plugins primarily on
their signatures compare from a system that uses metadata embedded by
plugin vendors?</p>

<h2>AOB on top of git?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs-jetpack/browse_thread/thread/ad480a97f9f1df84/1b958009d103ecf6?lnk=gst&amp;q=hilaiel#1b958009d103ecf6">some
discussion</a>
around how users get code into and out of <a href="https://builder.mozillalabs.com/">FlightDeck</a>.</p>

<p>One approach to address this need would be to have AOB expose an API
that would allow third party tools to read and write the revision
history of a project.  The other approach would be to have AOB use a
DVCS as its backing store and directly expose read or read/write access
to that.</p>

<p>Key questions: How viable would it be to move AOB&rsquo;s add-on storage on
top of a DVCS, and expose read (and later write) access?  What do you
win?  What do you lose?</p>
