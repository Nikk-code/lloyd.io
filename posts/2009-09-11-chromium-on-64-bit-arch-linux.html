title: chromium on 64 bit (arch) linux
<p>Really not much to write about, it was trivial to do, and <em>feels</em> a
hell of a lot faster than the burning fox.  Steps?</p>

<p>First, grab the latest build from the
<a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-linux-64/">chrome buildbot</a></p>

<p>Second, probably notice that the chrome binary won&rsquo;t run for
you&hellip; missing shared libs?  Heeey, me too!  Apparently we&rsquo;re building
with certain debug libs here.  use <code>ldd</code> to figger out what&rsquo;s missin,
and go create some symlinks:</p>

<p>Sunspider reports on my box chromium&rsquo;s js performance is is 4.87x
faster than that of the fox.  Don&rsquo;t get too excited, <a href="http://ericmiraglia.com/blog/?p=140">javascript
performance isn&rsquo;t everything</a>&hellip;</p>
