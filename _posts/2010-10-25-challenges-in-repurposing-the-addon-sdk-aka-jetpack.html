title: Challenges in Repurposing the Addon SDK (aka, jetpack)
layout: post
---

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been collaborating with Marcio Galli on the
<a href="http://mozillalabs.com/chromeless">chromeless project</a>
in Mozilla Labs, and one thing I like about the approach is that
it leverages huge swaths of the <a href="http://mozillalabs.com/jetpack">jetpack platform</a>.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Jetpack Got To Do With It?</h2>

<p>At first glance you may wonder what jetpack (making it possible to
write extensions in web technologies) could have to do with
the very different problem of making it possible to create a <em>browser</em>
in web technologies.  The answer is that the folks working on jetpack
had to solve a couple of interesting problems that are very relevant:</p>

<h3>A Module System For JavaScript</h3>

<p>Because JetPack represents a shift to writing potentially large and
complex extensions in javascript, the first thing that comes up is the
question of code organization.  How do we break the implementation
into several different files to support our abstractions?  How do we
share libraries between developers?</p>

<p>The solution in JetPack is something that looks like the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1">CommonJS
module specification</a>, and
one of the thing that jetpack provides is a mechanism for building and
consuming libraries of code in javascript.</p>

<h3>Module Documentation</h3>

<p>If your familiar at all with jetpack, you might have seen their built-in
documentation mechanism.  The way it works is the python scripts that compose
the interface to the platform spawn a local web server which can display
a combination of dynamically generated and static documentation.  Along the
way, JetPack has made some technology decisions and introduced some conventions
around documenting code that are not specific to generating extensions.</p>

<h3>Mozilla Platform Abstraction</h3>

<p>In addition to the concrete features mentioned above, the jetpack platform
provides the ability to generate idiomatic JavaScript APIs which can then be
implemented leveraging existing platform features, implemented themselves
in XPCOM, JavaScript, or even ctypes.</p>

<h2>How Do We Share the Jetpack Core?</h2>

<p>While the above was enough reason for Marcio and I to agree that
leveraging work in jetpack for chromeless was a Good Thing, this left
the question of How?  How can we have two distinct projects that
efficiently share large swaths of code without adding undue complications,
or limiting either&rsquo;s ability to move rapidly.  There seem to be at least
four arrangements worth mentioning:</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;One is the loneliest number&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; jetpack-sdk could be the
canonical source for building browsers, building addons, and whatever
else we dream up in the future.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;The messy breakup&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; fork, diverge, and cry.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;The great cuddlefish escape&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; slice the common bit out of the
jetpack-sdk and figure out how other repositories can consume that
thing conveniently and then layer their own modules, documentation,
and additional cfx features on top of it (i.e. addons want to export
to .xpi, skinned browsers want export to .dmg/.exe).</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Port Style&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; the new guy, &ldquo;chromeless-skinner-thingy&rdquo; can
consume jetpack-sdk from github, and layer a bit of love on top of it.
jetpack-sdk code wouldn&rsquo;t be duplicated, but rather be pulled as a
pre-build step.</p>

<p>Looking at these options, my thinking goes like this: <em>One is the
loneliest number</em> puts too much in a single repository and creates the
potential for far too much friction between the two different
projects.  <em>The messy breakup</em> (where we are today) is unacceptable
because we have to find and fix bugs twice, and there&rsquo;s no good way
to share improvements and new features added to common code.</p>

<p>This leaves two interesting solutions, <em>Port Style</em> and <em>The Great
Cuddlefish Escape</em>: Both would address some of the key issues, but the
<em>great escape</em> would arguably add risk prematurely to a project with
great momentum, jetpack.</p>

<p>For this reason the approach that I intend to pursue is <em>Port Style</em>
in the short term, and to work with the jetpack team to consider a
<em>Great Escape</em> in the future.</p>

<h2>The Plumbing</h2>

<p>Haven chosen an initial approach, the final question is how do we
actually pull and patch jetpack sources?  I&rsquo;d offer the following
proposed requirements:</p>

<p><strong>pre-build step</strong> &ndash; required dependencies are fetched as a (discoverable)
pre-build step.</p>

<p><strong>solves xulrunner acquisition</strong> &ndash; the largest source of issues thus
far has been in people trying to get the correct version of xulrunner
on their platform so they can try chromeless.  We there&rsquo;s an <a href="http://github.com/mozilla/chromeless/issues#issue/4">issue
open</a> to address
this, and because acquiring xulrunner is a similar problem to
acquiring the jetpack SDK, we should at least consider a combined
solution.</p>

<p><strong>explicit version tracking</strong> &ndash; the version of jetpack-sdk being tracked
should be captured in the chromeless repository.  That is, it should be
required that a developer confirm chromeless functions against a newer
version before the version we&rsquo;re targeting is updated.</p>

<p><strong>automatic update</strong> &ndash; If bob has checked out chromeless, and Jane
updates the version of the jetpack SDK that should be tracked (via sha1?)
and then bob pulls latest changes into his checked out chromeless,
then his jetpack-sdk should be <em>automatically</em> updated.</p>

<p>In considering these requirements, what seems to fit best is the
application of a little tool called <a href="http://github.com/lloyd/bakery">the
bakery</a> which was designed to solve
these very problems.  The benefit of using the bakery to fetch both
xulrunner and jetpack sdk is that all of the above requirements would
be satisfied, and it would be a very quick integration.  The downside
of using the bakery is that its written in ruby, and this would
require people wanting to work on chromeless would have to have ruby
installed, which is another build dependency and adds an unfortunate
barrier to entry&hellip;</p>

<p>Despite this, It seems like using the bakery on an experimental branch
may be a good place to start.  Once SDKs are generated, the ruby
requirement would not apply to folks wanting to <em>use</em> chromeless, only
those developing on it.</p>
