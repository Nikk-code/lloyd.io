title: ruby 1.8.6 vs 1.9 - performance & memory usage
<p>Seeing all this action in ruby trunk, combined with what I’ve read
’round the net had piqued my interest in 1.9 performance differences.</p>

<p>Given the set of contributed benchmarks that I used when developing the
<a href="http://gist.github.com/486747">inital patch</a> to
improve the reclamation and decrease memory usage of ruby, I did some
comparisons of
<a href="http://very.trickyco.de/projects/misc/1.8.6_vs_1.9-trunk.html">ruby 1.9 vs ruby 1.8.6</a>,
and of
<a href="http://very.trickyco.de/projects/misc/patched.1.8.vs.1.9.html">ruby 1.9 vs a patched ruby 1.8.6</a>.</p>

<p>In short, looking at this data leads me to some preliminary conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.9 is decidedly “faster” than 1.8.6. Especially when runtimes are longer, or yaml is involved.</li>
<li>1.9 uses slightly less memory overall.
*There is considerable room for improvement in 1.9’s memory reclamation.</li>
</ul>


<p>So why is memory usage important? Well, here I’m personally biased.
My primary day to day application of ruby is embedding. In this scenario,
I really want a small and tight ruby that I can use to move a buncha code
out of c++ and into ruby. I’m also interested in portability of ruby to
less capable devices. In both of these situations, memory usage is an
important factor. Additionally, I think more generally, low memory usage
minimizes the copy on write issues prevalent in ruby on rails environments.
If the process has a small, tight, compact heap, it doesn’t matter so much
that we have to copy the whole thing on each fork.</p>

<p>My educated guess here is that we could focus energy on minimizing
memory usage rather than a external bitset, and we’d get the desired
COW friendly ruby at a similar (minimal) performance cost, but the
solution would yield more across-the-board benefits. To be clear,
moving mark bits into a external data structure (and out of the heap)
is really an optimization focused at ruby in web environments that
comes with a cost. I don’t want to pay this <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/15827">performance
penalty</a>
for something that doesn’t really benefit me.</p>

<p>So I guess the task is to continue to follow 1.9 and to attempt to
figure out which 2 lines are inverted that could really make the difference…
It can’t be too hard, right?</p>

<p>till the next,</p>
