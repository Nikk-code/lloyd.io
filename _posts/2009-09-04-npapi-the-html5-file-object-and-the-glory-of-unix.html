title: NPAPI, the HTML5 File object, and the glory of UNIX
layout: post
---

<p>Earlier today I was impressing my wife with some unix foo by automatically swapping FIRST LAST &mdash;> LAST, FIRST formatted data while sorting and finding duplicated entries (ok, so she was only mildly impressed).  The shell command looked a little like this:</p>


<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[lth@lappro ~] $ ./first_to_last.rb &lt; new_names.txt | sort -f | uniq &gt; back_to_you_bob.txt</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Not rocket surgery, certainly, but still a great example of combining several small tools to achieve an end.  This simple act re-filled me with awe on the beauty of design with lots of little processes.  Processes enforce proper protocols and data hiding (unless you&rsquo;re talking about cross process windows or some other such tomfoolery), they guarantee 100% resource reclamation, they afford a robust system where if one guy falls down the party can still pick up and continue.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m like 2 years late here to this re-realization for the web: we
already all understand the beauty of lots of little processes.  The
Chrome browser started by moving plugins (and just about every other
distinct subtask) into it&rsquo;s own process.  IE8 joined the fray by
running each tab in a separate process.  Safari 4.0.3 on Snow Leopard
running 64bit puts npapi plugins on the other side of a process break.
The fine folks at mozilla are talking through it and will inevitably
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Plugins:PlatformIndependentNPAPI">follow
suit</a>.</p>

<p>So this is awesome.  Now our browsers don&rsquo;t crash as much, instead
they tell us &ldquo;The Yahoo! BrowserPlus plugin has crashed&rdquo; (for
instance, usually it&rsquo;s the Adobe Flash plugin, right?)..  They tell us
&ldquo;the page is unresponsive&rdquo;.  Blame is appropriately assigned so we, as
users, can complain to the right people.  Fewer human hours are
dwindled and more broken pages are fixed.  Followed by an era of
increased world peace and obesity.  Great.</p>

<h2>The File is the Thing</h2>

<p>In that code snippet above, it&rsquo;s really the file abstraction that
deserves all the glory.  Once we&rsquo;ve got all these processes, how do
they communicate?  Well, first and foremost they need to be able to
move data back and forth.  The simplest way to do this is in an opaque
blob.  A file if you will.  A container that is capable of holding
data that can be moved back and for between loosely coupled components
of the software system.</p>

<p>If you take a look at innovation on the web today, we&rsquo;ve got plenty of
separate processes, we&rsquo;ve got HTML5 goodness running in browser, we&rsquo;ve
got Gears running in a combination of plugins and extensions, we&rsquo;ve
got BrowserPlus running in an NPAPI plugin (or activex, but they
always have thought different), we&rsquo;ve got adobe flash in another
plugin, and if you&rsquo;re retro there&rsquo;s a little java soup in there too
(right, Silverlight too, don&rsquo;t forget!  this is important!).</p>

<p>Now in most cases, all of these runtimes/tools are running in
different processes.  And we have two choices: first they could be
extremely loosely coupled and only share a control channel that&rsquo;s
brokered by the browser (as the world is today), or they could be more
deeply integrated.  It could be possible to build a web application
using multiple client technologies that pass data back and forth.
Imagine using HTML5 drag and drop to attain file handles, passing
those into, say, BrowserPlus to process or alter the file contents,
then taking the result and uploading it peer to peer using, say flash?</p>

<p>A simple file abstraction shared by all of these platforms is the key
to interoperability.</p>

<h2>Why do we care?</h2>

<p>Why do we care if the interoperate?  Simply because we need to nurture
experiementation, and if there is no clean way for extensions to hook
into browser supported drag and drop, then we&rsquo;ll see monstrous hacks
arise to make them interoperate so that non browser companies can
continue participating in the innovation (without building yet another
browser, so yesterday).</p>

<h2>HTML5 and the File</h2>

<p>Some very cool happs are goin on over at the w3c regarding <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/FileUpload/publish/FileAPI.html">files,
uploading, and drag and
drop</a>.
Excellent work in a pretty package.</p>

<p>I especially like the way the file abstraction works, and deeply
suggest similar security policies to <a href="http://browserplus.org/docs/web_dev/JavaScript_API_Overview.html">what&rsquo;s present in
BrowserPlus</a>.
Specifically the notion that untrusted javascript may not construct a
file, but may freely pass it around between privileged apis that can
do stuff with it.  A key idea here being we leverage the user gesture
of dropping or (multi) selecting, once that&rsquo;s done they&rsquo;ve implicitly
authorized the page to do stuff with that file.  Yeah, I know, people
also like going phishing.</p>

<h2>The One (File) Two (Stream) Punch</h2>

<p>So is every browser going to implement powerful client-side movie
editing?  Or is this a bit bigger than what we want to build in the
browser?  Let&rsquo;s assume I can name a feature, X, that&rsquo;s interesting in
a browser, but more than we could ever expect microsoft, google,
apple, mozilla, and opera to go and implement.  The web is the
platform, right?  We still want to be able to build this in open web
technologies (uh, the user drops the movie on the page).</p>

<p>I suggest a simple fix on the npapi side.  Here&rsquo;s the patch:</p>

<p>So the key is these magic File objects in javascript are translated to
full paths as they are sent into plugins.  This leaves all the
selection, drag and drop, and upload up to the browser, and empowers
plugins the ability to seemlessly integrate with this brave new world.</p>

<p>Next we can talk about streams, which buy us an <em>efficient</em> way to
build a playground where everyone&rsquo;s workin' together.</p>

<p>simple, yeah?
