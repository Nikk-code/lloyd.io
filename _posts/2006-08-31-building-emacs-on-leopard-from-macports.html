title: building emacs on leopard from macports
<p>I cannot live without X11 emacs!  It doesn&rsquo;t build from macports right
now.  As far as I can tell, the emacs that apple ships with leopard is
broken, at least for me after upgrade I get:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[lth@tumno ~] $ /usr/bin/emacs.broken
Fatal malloc_jumpstart() error</pre></div>
</div>


<p>This blog entry documents the steps to get emacs built, installed and
in the macports registry.  So at the time of writing, this is the
package I&rsquo;m installing:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[lth@tumno ~] $ port search emacs | grep 22.1
emacs                          editors/emacs  22.1         The GNU Emacs text editor (command line only)</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Start by trying to install</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[lth@tumno ~] $ sudo port install emacs@gtk---&gt;  Fetching emacs

<p>So the apple folks have changed the structure of a dylib (to add, among other things, RPATH support.  that&rsquo;s a huge w00t)</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s patch this source.  Now for some reason, if we apply a patch directly
to the current state of the working directory, things go boom.  I&rsquo;m guessing
the fix doesn&rsquo;t play nice with other current patches applied by macports.
So I use a sledgehammer.  Download emacs-22.1, configure as you like,
apply <a href="http://gist.github.com/486469">this patch</a>
(credit to YAMAMOTO Mitsuharu for producing this patch) and build.
Then move the built emacs-22.1 into your working directory,
and port install.</p>

<p>The result for me is a emacs which runs in console mode.  once I get
X11 set up and running sawfish we&rsquo;ll see if it actually works in X11,
in the past the emacs-devel package was required for X11 support, and the
brief port description suggests this is still the case..</p>
