title: Parse JSON in ruby in 1/4 the time of YAML
layout: post

<p>Crazy claim, eh? I figure there’s no better way to get this claim tested that by posting it as a truth!</p>

<p>We’ll here’s the story: Once upon a time, lloyd (that&rsquo;s me) wanted <a href="http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/">a
parser that didn&rsquo;t suck</a> that he could
embed in a <a href="http://browserplus.yahoo.com/">particular product</a>,
primarily because he was sick of patching <a href="http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/">other peoples
code</a>: solving problems like:</p>

<ol>
<li>crashes on certain malformed inputs</li>
<li>the niggling tendency to scan <em>from the begging of the input text</em> every time a number was encountered</li>
<li>the requirement that you had to hold the full json text in memory at one time (usally in <em>addition</em> to an in-memory representation).</li>
</ol>


<p>To be fair, the project that I was previously using got a lot better,
but it still lacked a couple key features that were extremely
important to me: stream parsing, and representation independence. At
the time (and actually still), we were using JSON as the data
representation over our IPC channel (in that same particular product),
and this meant that a <em>lot</em> of data was flowing. We had one of two
options:</p>

<ol>
<li>throw away json and move to a binary format</li>
<li>make a json parser that caused the IPC serialization overhead to fall off our our profiles…</li>
</ol>


<p>Cause’ I love transparency over the wire (binary still ain’t that
scrutable), and because JSON is the representation language of the web
(hush now XML people) I decided to try to build this parser.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing, I’m rather stupid and short sighted, and didn’t
realize that it’s actually extremely well suited to high level
language bindings for other languages, say, ruby or python. Luckily,
<a href="http://github.com/brianmario">Brian Lopez</a> is not stupid, and he has
brought <a href="http://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/tree/master">yajl to
ruby</a>.</p>

<p>Initially Brian is reporting that it’s about 4 times as fast as YAML
parsing via <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/syck/">syck</a>, about 20%
faster than the other native JSON parser for
ruby](<a href="http://flori.github.com/json/)">http://flori.github.com/json/)</a> out there, and in general uses up
to &frac12; the memory (now this claim especially is difficult given the
exponential nature of the heap mechanism in ruby, so perhaps we need
to retry this with some of <a href="/improving-the-ruby-gc">them gc patches I wrote</a>,
or with 1.9).</p>

<p>I’m posting to re-iterate how awesome Brian and I are?  No, not
really. I’m posting to challenge skeptics to validate these findings,
just cause’ I was extremely pleased and surprised to hear these
numbers from brian, and a little bit of that rigor that comes from
public scrutiny couldn’t hurt…</p>

<p>till the next,
lloyd</p>
