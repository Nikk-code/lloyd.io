title: A Chromeless Snapshot
<p>There has been a ton of development in the Mozilla Labs
<a href="https://mozillalabs.com/chromeless"><em>Chromeless</em></a> project since the
<a href="https://mozillalabs.com/chromeless/2010/12/15/chromeless-0-1/">0.1 release</a>,
and I wanted to take a moment to give a snapshot of our progress.</p>

<h2>Application Generation</h2>

<p>Chromeless lets you build desktop apps with web technologies, but how do
package those up for distribution?  Back in january we implemented the ability
for chromeless to embed your <em>application code</em> into a standalone application.
On OSX the output is an <em>application bundle</em>, that is a special type of folder
with a <code>.app</code> extensions.  On linux and windows the output is a directory
with a single binary that is named the same as your application.</p>

<p>Usage is simple, just pass &lsquo;appify&rsquo; to chromeless on the command line:</p>

<pre><code class="no-highlight">$ ./chromeless appify examples/thumbnails
Generating a standalone, redistributable, application
Using Browser HTML at '/home/lth/dev/chromeless/examples/thumbnails/index.html'
Building application in &gt;/home/lth/dev/chromeless/build/My Chromeless App&lt; ...
  ... copying in xulrunner binaries
  ... placing xulrunner binary
Building xulrunner app in &gt;/home/lth/dev/chromeless/build/My Chromeless App&lt; ...
  ... copying application template
  ... creating application.ini
  ... copying in CommonJS packages
  ... copying in application code (/home/lth/dev/chromeless/examples/thumbnails)
  ... writing harness options
xul app generated in build/My Chromeless App</code></pre>

<p>Once this is complete you have a standalone app that you can combine with your
favorite installer technology to build a distributable application.</p>

<h2>Native Menus, and Keybindings!!</h2>

<p>Mike De Boer has contributed modules which expose access to native
menus and allow you to control the display and behavior of your
application menus.  Full documentation isn&rsquo;t yet available, but
there&rsquo;s some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/chromeless/blob/master/tests/menu/index.html">example
code</a>
available that demonstrates how you can build up menus with icon and
keybinding support:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110212-qkjw25fmhjgkrfkjjhphciaxuc.png" alt="Pretty Menus!" /></p>

<p>In addition to native menus, Mike has also put together a library to
allow one to programatically configure shotcut key combinations, or
<a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/chromeless-kit/hotkey"><em>hotkeys</em></a>.</p>

<h2>A Documentation System</h2>

<p>As of 0.1, chromeless had no documentation.  We&rsquo;ve take the system from jetpack and
reworked it a bit to fit for Chromeless.  To generate docs from Chromeless, pass <code>docs</code>
on the command line:</p>

<pre><code class="no-highlight">$ python2 ./chromeless docs
Generating documentation
Created docs in /home/lth/dev/chromeless/build/docs.</code></pre>

<p>While the content isn&rsquo;t very complete at this point, we now have a
usable system that we can update as we go.  You can checkout a
<a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless">snapshot of the chromeless docs</a> on our github pages.</p>

<h2>Startup Parameters</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to be able to control basic application parameters in a simple way.  To
specify things like the initial height and width of your application window, whether it&rsquo;s
resizable, the name of the application, and the icon that should be used to represent it.
To address this problem we now support a configuration file that may be placed in the
same directory as your <em>application code</em>: <code>appinfo.json</code>.  This configuration file looks
something like:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My First Browser&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.1&quot;,
  &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;appicon.png&quot;,
  &quot;resizable&quot;: true,
  &quot;initial_dimensions&quot;: {
    &quot;width&quot;: 500,
    &quot;height&quot;: 300
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Now while the only keys which are actually implemented right now are <code>name</code> and <code>version</code>, this
is a place where any configuration which changes the initial behavior of your application will
reside.</p>

<h2>File System Interaction</h2>

<p>Contributions from Mike De Boer and Alexandre Poirot have brought good
api breadth around filesystem interactions.  The basic design of the
file system APIs includes three different modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/api-utils/file">file</a> &ndash; Reading and writing of individual files</li>
<li><a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/chromeless-kit/path">path</a> &ndash; Provides abstractions for the manipulation of file paths, but will never touch the file system.</li>
<li><a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/chromeless-kit/fs">fs</a> &ndash; Includes functions which can query and manipulate the file system, and don&rsquo;t fit into the two categories above (for example, directory manipulation and file copy live here).</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to these low level utilities, the
<a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/chromeless-kit/app-paths"><code>app-paths</code></a>
offers an abstract way of getting at various standard filesystem paths.</p>

<h2>OS Drag and Drop</h2>

<p>Marcio Galli has put together <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/chromeless/tree/master/tests/dragdrop">example
code</a>
for how one might go about supporting drag-in and drag out in their
chromeless apps.  It mostly leverages HTML5 support with a teeny tiny
library to support native feeling drag-out.</p>

<h2>Favicons and Mime-Type guessing</h2>

<p>The mozilla platform (obviously) includes great tools for doing webby things!
One example is displaying favicons, and that&rsquo;s now wrapped up in a <a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/chromeless-kit/favicon">simple to use
library</a>.
In addition there&rsquo;s a new <a href="which%20leverages%20and%20augments%0Athe%20mime%20lookup%20built%20into%20the%20mozilla%20platform">mime guessing library</a> and lets you get a probable
mime type given a file path.</p>

<h2>Improved Embedding of Web Content</h2>

<p>One of the primary goals of chromeless is to make it possible to build web
browsers, and this means safely embedding web content is an important feature.
The approach we take in chromeless is to transparently <em>upgrade</em> iframes that
are direct children of your application code, to give you a deepened view as
to what&rsquo;s going on inside of them.</p>

<p>This <em>upgrading</em> concretely means two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>iframes in chromeless emit several <a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#guide/custom-dom-events">custom events</a></li>
<li>application code has increased priviledges to manipulate and inspect
web content inside iframes, via the
<a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/chromeless-kit/iframe-controls">`iframe-controls'</a>
library.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Better Console Output</h2>

<p>Mike De Boer has contributed tons of polish to the good ol' <code>console.log()</code> function, including pretty object introspection:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110212-xw5ss6dkamuxt4csa77dci2mtf.png" alt="Introspection!" /></p>

<h2>Simplified Web Requests</h2>

<p>The addon-sdk community has written a nice little request library
which simplifies issuing HTTP requests, and we&rsquo;ve uplifted that <a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/addon-kit/request">into
chromeless</a>.
Additionally, an API compatible version of
<a href="http://mozilla.github.com/chromeless/#module/api-utils/xhr"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a>
without the cross domain restriction is also available.</p>

<h2>BIAB, and TTYL</h2>

<p>Hopefully this whirlwind tour of new features in trunk gives you a
good grasp of the project&rsquo;s current state.  The speed at which things
are shaping up I feel is a testament to the quality of the platforms
upon which chromeless is built, and the sheer awesome of the
contributors.</p>

<p>Now, back to merging&hellip;</p>
